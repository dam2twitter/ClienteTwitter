Thanks to:

Charly, he finds out a missing feature for JTextComponents (incomplete keybindings).
He also provides great feedback thanks to SkinLF integration in its opensource project. 

Romain Guy, he persuades me to support JDK1.1 (this was not so easy:
replace all occurences of java.util.List by java.util.Vector and
cast java.awt.Component to javax.swing.JComponent to get support
for getX,getY,getWidth,getHeight methods :p)

Yiannis Paschalidis for the fix he sends:
	"Anyhow, after messing around with it for a while, I noticed a problem with
	the skinning of nested JPanels - the background bitmap didn't tile correctly
	as each panel starts tiling from 0,0 in the bitmap.
	Here's the fixed code for com.l2fprod.util.ImageUtils: [...]"

Joseph Shelby for the code snippet he sends:
	"but here's a "SkinFactory" that will load up the user's current GTK skin [...]"

Herve Lemaitre for providing the SkinRegion X11 Implementation. He also adds the creation
of region from an image.

Kevin L Wilson for submitting the SplitPane divider code and several bug fixes.

All the people asking for irregular window support

and many others submitting screenshots, suggestions, bug fixes...
